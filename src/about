<p style='padding-right: 10px'>Hi there, </br>
  I'm <b>Vincenzo di Cicco</b>, an italian Software Engineer.</br>
  I'm currently based in Rome where I've just finished my master degree in Computer Engineering.
  </br></br>
  Currently I'm trying to surf the wave of Machine Learning, but you can likely find me reading about Web Security,
  Distributed Systems, Programming in general or whatever seems cool to me (mainly reading through my
  <a href="https://twitter.com/0xNaN/">Twitter Feed</a>).
  </br></br>
  Sometime I do <a href=#>Bughunting</a> and I was lucky enough to be listed in the <a href=#>Google Bughunting hall of fame</a>.

  I've always said that I want to do a serious course on cooking, but still I've not done it :)
